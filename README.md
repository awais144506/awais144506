## 📝 Latest Projects
### 1. Campus Synchronization WebEcosystem 
 As my campus lacked a public information website, student portal (mobile application), and admin portal with additional features, my team and I developed an entire system as our final year project. While it may not meet industry standards, it was a tremendous learning experience where I utilized the latest tech stacks. You can find this project pinned in my profile repository.

- Tech Stack: NextJS, Node.js, Vercel, React Native, TailwindCSS, Appwrite Cloud, GitHub
